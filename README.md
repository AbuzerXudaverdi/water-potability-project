### Water Potability Project
ML project for SCI project assignment
# Introduction
Potable water is the water which is safe to drink. Access to potable water is crucial for our health, and it's a basic human right. Demand for safe-to-drink&use water is increasing continously, but resources of such kind of water are not. In this project, we have a dataset that contains several features including ph levels, amount of sulfate (mg/L) etc. These features are categorized into 9 columns and one additional column which tells us if the water sample is potable or not. If the sample is potable, corressponding row's value in 'Potability' row is not, and it's zer otherwise.
